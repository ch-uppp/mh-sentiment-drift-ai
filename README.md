# mh-sentiment-drift-ai
A modular engine for detecting emotional tone shifts in conversational AI — designed to power emotionally adaptive, mental health and safety-aware generative systems.

---

## Overview

This project provides a foundation for detecting sentiment drift — subtle or sudden changes in emotional tone across user interactions. Originally developed for use in mental health-oriented GenAI, it is applicable to any domain where emotional awareness, tone adjustment, or escalation are critical.

This is not a sentiment model — it is a lightweight, model-agnostic framework for tracking how sentiment changes over time and signaling when an adaptive response may be needed.



### Why This Matters

As generative AI systems take on more emotionally sensitive roles — in coaching, support, or mental health — we need infrastructure that tracks not just *what* users say, but *how they're changing* over time. 

This repo is a step toward building that emotional intelligence layer: modular, interpretable sentiment drift detection designed to be embedded directly into LLM workflows.


### Testing and Evaluation

Initial testing has been done on synthetic emotional narratives and anonymized mental health counselling sessions. We're developing a benchmark set for more rigorous evaluation of tone shift detection performance across domain
